# Children's Museum Exhibit
A fun and interactive exhibit for the Children's Museum at Brazos Valley

## Design Process
We were tasked with rewvamping the whole right side of the exhibit as the kids did not find it engaging. It was just a ball going down the sprial path shown below.
They gave us permission to do whatever we wanted as long as the total comes under $500. After a some brainstorming, we came up with a few ideas: replace the spiral path
with a box, atach sliders so that you can control the path of the ball as it comes down. The ball would make its way to a ball catch that we we mremake since the old one 
was broken. Also we decided on making an Archimedes screw just to teach children the basic principles.
